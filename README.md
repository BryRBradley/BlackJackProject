## BlackJackProject

### Description
This java application can explain the rules of BlackJack and basic game play. It then simulates a game of BlackJack with a single player and the Dealer. 
It displays Cards suits, values and total and takes in UI for desicions to Hit or Stay. There is built in logic to determine the hand winner according 
to traditional BlackJack rules display the Round# and will continue until the users responds that they dont want to play another rounnd. 

### Technology Used
Eclipse IDE
Github
Sublime
MacOS terminal
Java . Microsoft Word
UML
Zoom and Slack for troubleshooting and Senior developer input

### Project Goals
This project I wanted to focuss on the coding the project in sequence according the my UML plan and layout. 

In addition I strived to translate my thoughts in english to code and allow the IDE to assist me as I built out the framework.
I really wanted to code eveything I knew how to before recieving any outside help. When I got stuck I woul make a note in my code
in English of what I wanted it to do and then translate it. I had some issue pulling infomation due to encapsulation and with 
some TA help I can honestly say I wrote 85% without help which was huge for me. 
I wanted to focuss more on "write a little test a little" methodology and test as I write to help me better understand the Logic of 
writing the code not just the syntax. 

### Lessons Learned
I worked on developing better workflow step habits. Code-Test-Commit

When thinking through UML "Macro to Micro" plan for "test-lines". I did alot better than the Jets Project in testing as I wrote. It helped me to follow the follow of what
I need to do next and when I had a problem. 

Utilized all the TA Hours and it was a huge boost to my understanding and the application of what we have been learning. I am super grateful for the extra help and reviewing some topics that I didn't have a good grasp on. I would have been stuck on this project without these hours. Instead I am surprised at how much I have already learned. I will absolutely be there again next Saturday. It also really started to connect some dots on the application of the 
sytax we have been learning. When I am learning a lauguage I have always struglled to "speak it" until I understand the gramtical structure and rules. I am trying to apply this same logic to Java the more I understand the how/why 
and structure the more my mind can think through how to code it. 

### Coding Time and Testing
08 Mar 24 1500-20030 // V1 of BlackJackApp, methods, files initial builds were completed.
09 Mar 24 1000-1600 // V2 pushed corrected a bunch of logic problems and wrote in test lines to break apart my code for debugging. Teamed up with Mary H to solve and finalized the App logic.
09 Mar 24 1800-1830 // V3  Had a classmate review and stress test he pointed out some small things and help me to solve my Arraylist clear issue after each game. 
10 Mar 24 1900-2100 // V4 README.md finished and final refactoring, applications meets all requirments.
